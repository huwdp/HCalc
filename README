# HCalc
## Description
HCalc is a Reverse Polish notation calculator built to research how mathematics expressions can be parsed and calculated.  This project was going to start out as a calculator and eventually turn into an interpreter but did not. [HuwInterpreter](https://github.com/huwdp/huwinterpreter-mirror) was created instead. I made this project in my spare time as someone wanted me to learn how infix to postfix and postfix evaluation works in the past so I created this project.

This project might be expanded upon in the future. The system is just meant to give an example of how the shunting algorithm (infix to postfix and postfix evaluation) works.
